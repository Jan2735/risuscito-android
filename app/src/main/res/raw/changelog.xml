        <changelogimprovement>IMPORTANT: From the next app version (4.4.0) the settings backup/restore system will change and migrating the actual online backup won't be possible.
        I reccomend you to keep on a phone/tablet the settings you need. After the update you will be able to backup them again with the new system (visually nothing will change).</changelogimprovement>
